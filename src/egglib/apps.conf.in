This file defines the correct command required to launch applications
integrated in EggLib.

The data specified in this file will not be effective until:
    1. EggLib built and installed:
      For a first installation:
        $python setup.py build
        $python setup.py install
      For reconfiguring applications, calling build_apps is required:
        $python setup.py build_apps
        $python setup.py install

    2. ABSOLUTE PATHS WITHOUT SHELL SHORTCUTS have been provided.
      good: /home/albert/software/PAML/codeml
      BAD!: ~/software/PAML/codeml
      BAD!: ../PAML/codeml

    3. The program can be launched at configuration time.

All programs that EggLib might use are listed below. One program must
use exactly one line. The format is as follow:
>program  #  command  #  [options] [:file]

The two # symbols and the leading > symbol are mandatory.

program: Must not be modified.
command: Must be the exact command required to launch the program.
         Usually, it is the same as the program name. In some cases
         the actual program name might be different as for example for
	   primer3, for which the program is actually named primer3_core.
         If the program is not placed in a directory of the PATH (aka
         a system directory), you might need to specify its path. In
         that case DO NOT specify relative path: the path should start
         from the root (/) or a volume identifier on Windows.
options: You can specify one or more options to be used during the
         configuration. These options will be used only when setup.py
         will verify if the program is installed. The point is mostly to
         prevent program from hanging while expecting arguments. Options
         cannot contain spaces, even when escaped with \ or embedded in 
         quotes. It is possible to specify redirection (or pipe) symbols
         in combination with file names (or programs).
file:    The same as for option. Specify one or more file names to
         temporarily create when attempting to run the program. The
         files will always be empty. It is illegal to specify the name
         of a file which already exists. File names cannot contain
         spaces, even when escaped with \ or embedded in quotes.

Everything is ignored until here.
