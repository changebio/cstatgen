1. REQUIREMENTS

Requires a C++ compiler. Tested with the GNU Compiler Collection and
known to compile under cygwin under Windows and MacOS system.

The following packages are optional. If they are not present at
compile time, certain features of egglib-cpp will not be available.

    - Bio++ libraries (version 2.0.0 or above)
        - bpp-core (required for other Bio++ libraries)
        - bpp-seq (for the method egglib2bpp of Convert)
        - bpp-popgen (for the class BppDiversity)
        - URL: <http://biopp.univ-montp2.fr/>
        
    - The GNU Scientific Library (gsl)
        - Required for the ABC class
        - Developed using gsl 1.9, but it is probable that older
          versions will work (at least 0.9)
        - URL: <http://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/>

2. PROCEDURE

egglib-cpp source packages are created using GNU autotools. Therefore
the installation procedure is standardized:

    sh configure
    make
    make install

Use options of the `configure` script to control the installation
(compiler options, non-standard library locations etc.). Typically, use
the `--prefix=PATH` option to install the egglib-cpp library and its
headers in a given location.
